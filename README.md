An example web app to demonstrate sending emails from a GMail account. This [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) app accepts a POST request and uses the [gmail](https://github.com/gmailgem/gmail) gem to send an email with the provided subject and body.

This little app provided me an opportunity to explore unit testing and code coverage in Ruby using [minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest), [rack-test](https://github.com/brynary/rack-test), and [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov).
